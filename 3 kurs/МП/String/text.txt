Most nights we used to mess around in the park around the corner from my house. I lived in
Hertfordshire, but I might just as well have lived in any suburb in England: it was that sort of
suburb, and that sort of park — three minutes away from home, right across the road from a little
row of shops (a VG supermarket, a newsagent, an off-license). There was nothing around that
could help you get your geographical bearings; if the shops were open (and they closed at fivethirty, and one o'clock on Thursdays, and all day Sunday), you could go into the newsagent's and
look for a local newspaper, but even that might not give you much of a clue.
 We were twelve or thirteen, and had recently discovered irony — or at least, what I later
understood to be irony: we only allowed ourselves to play on the swings and the roundabout and
the other kids' stuff rusting away in there if we could do it with a sort of self-conscious ironic
detachment. This involved either an imitation of absentmindedness (whistling, or chatting, or
fiddling with a cigarette stub or a box of matches usually did the trick) or a flirtation with danger,
so we jumped off the swings when they could go no higher, jumped on to the roundabout when it
would go no faster, hung on to the end of the swingboat until it reached an almost vertical
position. If you could somehow prove that these childish entertainments had the potential to dash
your brains out, then playing on them became OK somehow.
