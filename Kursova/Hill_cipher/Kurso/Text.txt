I play 'Got to Get You off My Mind' by Solomon Burke, and everyone has a go, just out of
duty, even though only the best dancers would be able to make something of it, and nobody in
the room could claim to be among the best dancers, or even among the most average. When
Laura hears the opening bars she spins round and grins and makes several thumbs-up signs, and I
start to compile in my head a compilation tape for her, something that's full of stuff she's heard
of, and full of stuff she'd play. Tonight, for the first time ever, I can sort of see how it's done.
